    INPUTS:
    Prompts user for name of comma-separated text file containing MemberHub directory dump.
    OUTPUTS:
    Dictionary keyed by file line number with values that are dictionaries with the following keys:
        This function assumes the directory dump fields are in this order:
        1.  "person_id"
        2.  "last_name"
        3.  "first_name"
        4.  "middle_name"
        5.  "suffix"
        6.  "email"
        7.  "family_id"
        8.  "family_relation"
        9.  "maiden_name"
        10. "born_on"
        11. "gender"
        12. "parents"
        13. "street"
        14. "city"
        15. "state"
        16. "zip"
        17. "home_number"
        18. "work_number"
        19. "work_number_ext"
        20. "fax_number"
        21. "mobile_number":
        22. "mobile_provider"
        23. "allow_sms"
        24. "hubs"
        25. "hubs_administered"
        26. "person_created"
        27. "person_updated"
        28. "account_created"
        29. "account_updated"
        30. "last_login"
    ASSUMPTIONS:
    1. Each line should contain exactly 30 fields that are separated by just a comma (','),
    and none of the fields contain commas.
    2. Lines that contain blank first or last names will be flagged, but not added to the 
    output dictionary.
    3. Each line ends in up to 3 new line escape characters, but the last field is last login,
    which should not be used.
